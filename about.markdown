Walking to stores for everyday or situational needs is not always everyone's liking, but it is an obligatory part of modern life for most of us. Srimad Bhagavad Gitashram greets customers who come here while shopping and are intending to buy something.

Here people can buy books. Many shops are expected to utilize a civil treatment of their customers. However, if you experience problems (or benefits) while shopping here, then feel free to describe your opinion to share with other users and to affect this establishment's score accordingly.
